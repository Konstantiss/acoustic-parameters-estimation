# Room acoustic behaviour estimation with machine learning

### Abstract
In todayâ€™s world, machine learning and neural networks have taken a firm place in
the everyday life of the average person. Moreover, deep learning networks are now an
essential and integral tool in every scientific discipline for solving multidimensional
and diverse problems. Inevitably, therefore, the field of room acoustics has also
incorporated machine learning into its problem-solving techniques for all kinds of
problems. In this thesis, we explore the use of deep learning networks to estimate
acoustic parameters of a space, and provide a comparative analysis between the
architectures used and similar publications.
